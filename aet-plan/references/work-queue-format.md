# Work Queue Format

## File Location

`.agents/work-queue.json`

## Design Principle

The queue file stores **persistent facts** and the canonical `state` for each task. Reads (`aet-work status`, `aet-work next`, the orchestrator) project the stored `state` directly; they do not recompute pickability from git on every read. A separate `aet-state audit` command reconciles stored state against git ground truth on demand.

## Task States

Valid values for `tasks[].state`:

- `planned` — The plan file exists. No local branch has been created yet.
- `ready` — Pickable: all blockers are terminal.
- `blocked` — At least one blocker is not terminal.
- `in_progress` — A branch/worktree has been created and the task is being implemented.
- `awaiting_merge` — Implementation finished; waiting for merge to `origin/main`. **Does not satisfy blockers.**
- `merged` — The branch or `merge_commit` is an ancestor of `origin/main`. **Terminal.**
- `abandoned` — The task was explicitly cancelled with a documented reason. **Terminal.**
- `failed` — Implementation or transition failed; requires human inspection.

## State Transitions

`aet-state transition` is the only writer of `state`. Legal transitions:

```text
sync:        ∅ → planned
sync:        planned → blocked            (pending_blockers > 0)
sync:        planned → ready              (pending_blockers == 0)
transition:  blocked → ready              (last blocker reached terminal)
transition:  ready → in_progress          (branch + worktree recorded)
transition:  in_progress.stage advances   (tdd → implement → qa → review → cso → sync-docs)
transition:  in_progress → awaiting_merge (pipeline exited 0; NOT terminal)
transition:  awaiting_merge → merged      (TERMINAL; merge_commit verified once)
transition:  any → abandoned (reason)     (TERMINAL)
transition:  in_progress → failed         (needs inspection; may re-enter)
```

When a task reaches a terminal state, the writer decrements each dependent's `pending_blockers` and promotes any that reach `0` from `blocked` to `ready`.

## Live / Settled Partition

`.agents/work-queue.json` holds only non-terminal tasks. When a task transitions to a terminal state (`merged` or `abandoned`), it is appended to `.agents/work-history.jsonl` and removed from the live file atomically. The orchestrator, `status`, and `next` never load settled history for scheduling.

## Auditing Stored State

To reconcile stored state against git ground truth, run:

```bash
python3 aet-work/bin/aet-state audit [.agents/work-queue.json]
```

`audit` reports every task whose stored state disagrees with the state expected from `branch`, `merge_commit`, `blocked_by`, and `plan_file` existence. It never mutates the queue.

In this example:

- `T1` is stored as `merged`; it has been sealed to history and is no longer in the live file.
- `T2` is stored as `ready` because `T1` is terminal.
- `T3` is stored as `blocked` because `T2` is not terminal.
