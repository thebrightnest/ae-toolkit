# GitHub Issues Is a Projection, Not a Backend

## Status

Accepted. Supersedes ADR-014 (Optional GitHub Issues Adapter for the Work Queue).

## Context

ADR-014 offered GitHub Issues as an optional *backend adapter* while keeping JSON as the canonical default. It described a "GitHub backend" that mirrored tasks as issues and AET states as labels, with the local JSON queue continuing to hold scheduling state.

When the forge-projection work was grounded, three facts made that framing untenable:

1. **`task_backend: "github"` never stored state in GitHub.** Its `load` and `save` methods read and wrote the local JSON queue file. Selecting "GitHub" only attached label side-effects to transitions; the ledger stayed on disk.
2. **`task_backend: "both"` was unimplemented.** The configuration value that would have expressed "git-refs ledger *and* GitHub Issues" raised `NotImplementedError`, so users could not ask for the actually desired shape.
3. **Storage and visibility are different axes.** Whether the ledger lives in JSON, git-refs, or another durable store is independent of whether a forge such as GitHub Issues receives a one-way mirror of state.

Treating GitHub Issues as a backend therefore described a capability that did not exist, while hiding the real capability — a projection — behind a storage-shaped config value.

## Decision

Projections are an axis **orthogonal to storage**. No configuration value may name a forge as a source of truth.

1. **`task_backend` selects only storage.** Valid values name durable storage implementations (e.g., `json`, `git-refs`). Values such as `github` or `both` are removed.
2. **A projection is a one-way mirror.** It receives state changes from the single state writer and updates an external surface (issue labels, issue state). It never writes back into AET state and is never read by AET commands.
3. **Projection config lives under a separate `projections` key.** The config shape is a list so additional forge types can be added without touching storage configuration.
4. **GitHub Issues is the first projection type.** It is optional, opt-in, and creates/updates issues keyed by plan id.
5. **AET remains the only writer to GitHub Issues.** Issues are created and mutated only by the projection dispatcher; humans do not file, relabel, or close them by hand as part of the workflow.

## Consequences

- **Easier:** The config surface matches reality. A team can run `git-refs` storage and a GitHub Issues projection simultaneously, which was the intended shape all along.
- **Easier:** The standing fence "no forge as source of truth" becomes structural rather than cultural.
- **Easier:** New forge types (e.g., Azure DevOps work items) can be added as new projection implementations without touching storage backends.
- **Harder:** Existing configs that selected `task_backend: "github"` must be updated. This is acceptable because that value never stored anything in GitHub; there is no data to migrate.
- **Harder:** The projection surface needs its own failure semantics. See ADR-033.

## Relation to ADR-014

ADR-014 correctly identified the need for team visibility in GitHub Issues while preserving infra-agnostic defaults. What it framed as an optional *backend adapter* is reframed here as an optional *projection*. The JSON-queue default, the plan-file content model, and the single-writer invariant remain unchanged; only the config axis and the direction of data flow are clarified.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep `task_backend: "github"` and implement real GitHub storage.** Rejected: it would make a forge authoritative, violate infra-agnosticism, and add network/forge dependencies to the storage path.
2. **Keep `task_backend: "github"` as a deprecated alias for the projection.** Rejected: it preserves a misleading storage-shaped name and weakens the structural fence.
3. **Use a boolean `github_issues: true` flag instead of a `projections` list.** Rejected: it collapses the axis back to one forge and complicates adding a second projection type later.
