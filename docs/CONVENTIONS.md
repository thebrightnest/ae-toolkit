# AE Toolkit Conventions

This document defines the patterns and standards for authoring, editing, and maintaining skills in this repository.

---

## Project Structure

Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Required. Skill instructions (YAML frontmatter + markdown body)
├── examples/             # Required. Usage examples and sample outputs
│   └── README.md
└── references/           # Required. Detailed reference material, edge cases, deep dives
    └── README.md
```

Skills are installed together from this repository via `npx skills add ... --all`. The pipeline only works when the whole system is present.

## Maintenance Scripts

`scripts/` contains repository-maintenance tooling: validation scripts, git
hooks, and release guards. One-off data migrations that have already been
applied are archived in `scripts/archive/` with a README explaining the release
they shipped in. Do not add new migrations to the root of `scripts/`; either
archive them after use or turn them into reusable maintenance scripts.

### Validate Gate

`make validate` is the repo's only safety net. It runs every check, fail-fast.
When a change touches nothing but prose, pytest is skipped entirely; the
remaining lint stages still run. This fast path is safe only because no test
module reads Markdown from the checkout outside `tests/`. Any new test that
does so will fail the regression guard in `tests/test_change_scope.py`.

For code changes, `make validate` asks `src/aet/change_scope.py` for the
smallest safe set of pytest targets. `change_scope` keeps an explicit,
path-prefix → test-dir mapping in `src/aet/change_scope.py:_PATH_TARGETS` and
**fails toward the full suite**: any `conftest.py`, shared fixture, unmapped
path, or undetermined diff returns `tests/` rather than risk a silent skip.
The installer smoke test (`tests/installer/test_installer.py`) is included
only when the installer surface (`scripts/install.sh` or `src/aet/cli/setup.py`)
changed. Add a mapping entry when a new subsystem has a dedicated test
directory; until then the safe fallback runs the whole suite.

## Package-Deliverable Rules

AE Toolkit is installed together, not à la carte. Skills may reference shared conventions, cross-skill rules, and toolkit-level docs because the whole system is present at runtime.

Rules:

- Put rules that are specific to one skill inside that skill's files (`SKILL.md`, `references/`, `examples/`, or scripts in `<skill>/bin/`).
- Put cross-cutting rules in toolkit-level docs (`.agents/reference/`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`).
- It is fine for a skill to reference another skill or a shared convention by name (e.g., "run `aet-validate-scope` next"). Do not rely on hardcoded paths that assume a specific install location.
- If a rule must be visible to an agent that reads only the skill file (e.g., when a skill is pasted into chat), include the essential version of that rule directly in `SKILL.md` or link to a skill-level reference doc.

## Skill Binaries

Skills are pure content (markdown instructions, examples, and references). All executable helpers have been extracted into importable Python modules under `src/aet/cli/<name>.py`. There are no executable scripts inside skill directories.

Rules:

- Skill instructions must invoke helpers through the `aet` dispatcher (e.g. `aet state record-merge`), not by hardcoded agent-specific paths or retired binary names.
- Skills that depend on helpers must include a **Prerequisites** section telling the user how to install the `aet` dispatcher onto `PATH`.
- `aet setup link` requires the `aet` Python package to be installed first. Skill installers must not assume that `npx skills` (which copies markdown content) installed the package; document `pip install` from the repo or PyPI as the prerequisite step.
- The canonical installer is `aet setup link`, implemented in `src/aet/cli/setup.py` and exposed through the installed console script (`aet = "aet.cli:main"`). It symlinks `aet` into `~/.local/bin` (or `AET_BIN_DIR`).
- `make install-skills` in this repo installs the package editable and runs `aet setup link` automatically for the local development workflow.

## AET Configuration

`aet-work` reads its backend and integration config through an external-first
precedence chain so that AET can run without committing any AET _config_ to a
shared repo. ADR-048 records the two-layer model and the rename from the legacy
`.agents/aet-work.json` file.

### Resolution Order

Config is resolved in this order; the first source that exists wins:

1. `AET_WORK_CONFIG` environment variable (path to a JSON config file)
2. `~/.aet/{config-slug}/config.json` (shadow / personal layer)
3. In-tree `.agents/aet-config.json` (team layer)
4. Built-in defaults (`{"task_backend": "git-refs"}`)

`{config-slug}` is the main-worktree identity derived by `derive_config_slug()`;
it drops the worktree label so one personal config serves every linked worktree
of the same repo. `AET_PROJECT_ID` or `AET_REPO_SLUG` override the derived slug.
The in-tree file is resolved against the repository root
(`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), never the process cwd.

### Adoption Modes

| Mode  | Where config lives                    | Best for                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Team  | `.agents/aet-config.json` (committed) | Whole team shares one backend/mode setup.     |
| Shadow | `~/.aet/{config-slug}/config.json`   | Solo adoption on a shared repo; zero footprint. |

Use `aet configure --guided` to choose the mode and integration mode in two
questions; the command writes the file in the right place with valid values.
Direct writes use `--scope project` for the team file or `--scope user` for the
shadow file. Guided mode exposes the same choice as `--scope team|shadow`.

### Shadow Mode Setup

Keep AET config out of the repo entirely:

```bash
aet configure --guided --scope shadow --integration-mode pr-per-task
```

This writes config to `~/.aet/{config-slug}/config.json` and touches nothing
inside the repo. Plans, PRDs, and other project artifacts remain versioned in
`docs/` as usual; only the AET backend/mode config leaves version control.

### Team Mode Setup

For self-hosted or team-wide AET adoption, commit the config in-tree:

```bash
aet configure --guided --scope team --integration-mode pr-per-task
```

This writes `.agents/aet-config.json`. Because reads are external-first, an
external config (if present) will still take precedence.

### Upgrading from the Legacy File

If the repo contains only the legacy `.agents/aet-work.json` file, any
config-reading command fails closed and names the migration command:

```bash
aet configure --migrate
```

`--migrate` renames the file to `.agents/aet-config.json` (using `git mv` when
the file is tracked) and refuses to overwrite an existing new file.

### Branch / Integration Model

Three settings control how AET maps tasks to branches and merges. Config values
are resolved external-first, just like `task_backend`.

| Setting              | Meaning                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trunk_branch`       | The final merge target for every task (e.g., `main`, `master`).         |
| `integration_branch` | The parent branch for feature work and the base for stacked work.       |
| `integration_mode`   | `pr-per-task` (default) or `single-pr`.                                 |

`aet setup verify` prints the resolved `trunk_branch`, `integration_branch`, and
`integration_mode` with provenance — `config`, `detected` from
`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, or `fallback` to `main`.

#### Resolution Order

**`trunk_branch`** is resolved in this order:

1. `trunk_branch` in config
2. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
3. Fallback to `main`

**`integration_branch`** is resolved in this order:

1. `--base` CLI flag
2. `AET_WORK_BASE_BRANCH` environment variable
3. `integration_branch` in config
4. `trunk_branch` (via the same trunk resolution above)

**`integration_mode`** is resolved from config only; it defaults to `pr-per-task`
and must be one of `pr-per-task` or `single-pr`.

This is a branch/integration model, not a worktree model. Worktrees are a
mechanical implementation detail; the integration branch is the semantic input.

#### Scenario: One Engineer, Shared Repo, Plans on a Feature Branch, `single-pr`

You want to keep all plan updates on one long-running branch and ship them
through a single PR, while still using AET's queue and state machine locally.

1. Create a shadow AET config so the repo stays free of AET config:

   ```bash
   aet configure --guided --scope shadow --integration-mode single-pr
   ```

2. Edit `~/.aet/{config-slug}/config.json` to point `integration_branch` at the
   long-running feature branch:

   ```json
   {
     "task_backend": "git-refs",
     "integration_mode": "single-pr",
     "integration_branch": "docs-roadmap"
   }
   ```

3. Leave `trunk_branch` unset so it resolves from `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
   (or set it explicitly to `main`).

4. Run plans on the `docs-roadmap` branch:

   ```bash
   aet run --base docs-roadmap
   ```

   `aet-work` uses `docs-roadmap` as the worktree base, and `aet-ship` targets
   the resolved trunk as the final merge destination. `aet setup verify` shows
   exactly which trunk the current checkout resolves to.

## Planning Artifact Directories

The `docs/` directory has strict boundaries for planning documents. Only atomic, implementable task plans may live in `docs/plans/`; all other planning artifacts belong in their designated directories.

| Directory        | Purpose                                                                        | Queue Ingestion                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/plans/`    | Atomic, implementable task plans (single session, one coherent behaviour change) | Yes — `aet init-queue` and `aet queue sync` scan this directory |
| `docs/prds/`     | Product Requirements Documents                                                 | No                                                        |
| `docs/roadmaps/` | Multi-phase roadmaps, completion trackers, meta-plans                          | No                                                        |
| `docs/audits/`   | Testing audits, strategy reviews, gap analyses                                 | No                                                        |

Rules:

- A document in `docs/plans/` that references other plan files or contains multiple "Phase" sections is non-atomic and must be moved to `docs/roadmaps/` or `docs/audits/`.
- The task-list-length check is no longer an intake filter; plan size is measured after implementation, not gated before it (see ADR-046). A plan that is genuinely non-atomic belongs in `docs/roadmaps/` or `docs/audits/` by the ADR-006 atomicity boundary, not because a proxy count rejected it.
- Directory creation is the user's responsibility; skills document the convention but do not auto-create directories.

## Plan Frontmatter Contract

Every atomic plan file in `docs/plans/` must begin with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: { ticket-id }
size: S/M/L
blocked_by:
  - { blocker-id }
---
```

- `id` must match the plan filename stem and be unique within the PRD family.
- `blocked_by` is the authoritative dependency list; prose dependency sections are ignored by `aet queue sync`.
- `size` is the S/M/L complexity label from the guardrail model.
- `stage` lives only in the task record, never in plan frontmatter.

`aet queue sync` validates the contract and fails closed on missing or duplicate IDs, unknown blockers, mismatched filenames, or invalid size values.

## SKILL.md Format

### YAML Frontmatter

Every `SKILL.md` must begin with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Explicit trigger description. When to use this skill. What user requests should activate it.
---
```

Rules:

- `name` must match the directory name.
- `description` is the trigger. Be explicit about invocation conditions (e.g., "Use when the user asks to create a skill, update a skill, or write skill instructions").
- No other frontmatter keys unless justified.

### Body Structure

1. **H1 Title** matching the skill name.
2. **When to Use** — bullet list of explicit trigger situations.
3. **Instructions** — procedural steps the agent must follow. Use imperative voice.
4. **Examples** (optional) — if present, keep brief and link to `examples/README.md` for full samples.
5. **Rules** (optional) — hard constraints ("Never...", "Always...").

Length: Keep `SKILL.md` under 400 lines. Move deep detail to `references/`.

## Writing Style

- **Imperative voice:** "Scan the project", "Research best practices", "Run the test suite".
- **Explicit triggers:** The `description` and "When to Use" section should make invocation unambiguous.
- **No agent assumptions:** Skills must work with Claude, Kimi, Cursor, Codex, or paste-into-chat. Do not reference tool-specific syntax unless unavoidable.
- **Concise over verbose:** Agents have context windows. Every sentence should carry instructions, not fluff.

## Naming Conventions

- Skill directories: kebab-case (`aet-setup`, `aet-validate-scope`).
- Files inside skills: `SKILL.md`, `README.md` (examples/references).
- ADR files: `NNN-title-in-kebab-case.md`.

## Error Handling

- If a skill cannot complete its task, it must explain why and what the user should do next.
- Never silently skip a step because a file is missing; document the skip in output.

## Task Size Guardrails

All planning output must be implementable in a single agent coding session. Use the context-budget + coherence model to shape the plan; the actual diff size is measured at closure, not guessed at intake (see ADR-046).

### Guardrail Model

A plan/task is a candidate for splitting when **two or more** of the following signals are true. One tripped signal is a prompt to justify the shape in writing, not an order to split.

1. **Expected diff guidance** (skill-level only, not validator-enforced):
   - Task: > 600 expected diff lines.
   - Story: > 1,200 expected diff lines.
2. **Human-time sanity check** (skill-level guidance, not validator-enforced):
   - Story: > 2 human-days.
   - Task: > 1 human-day.
3. **Subsystem coherence** (skill-level guidance):
   - Touches files in more than 2 distinct implementation subsystems. A _subsystem_ is a bounded module or layer with its own ownership boundary — in this repo, for example: `src/aet/` (CLI code + its tests), `skills/` (skill content), `.agents/` (workflow infrastructure). `docs/` changes and the tests that belong to a code change do not count as additional subsystems; code + its tests are one concern.
   - Requires maintaining more than one major architectural invariant at a time.
4. **Context budget** (skill-level guidance):
   - Loading the plan + all files to modify + relevant tests would exceed ~60k tokens for a task or ~100k tokens for a story.

No plan-time proxy for diff size is enforced at intake. Two proxies have been measured and retired: file count, and task-list length. The latter correlated with delivered code diff at only **r = 0.30**, with a flat relationship past roughly six task-list lines, so `validate_size()` no longer rejects on task-list length. See ADR-046 for the full measurement and the decision to move size measurement to closure.

### Size Labels

Every task must carry an S/M/L label. A label is an advisory prediction calibrated against measured delivery, not an intake limit.

| Label | Human Time             | Expected Diff Lines |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| S     | ≤ 2 hr                 | ≤ 150               |
| M     | ≤ 1 day                | ≤ 600               |
| L     | > 1 day OR > 600 lines | — justify above 1500 |

An L task must be re-evaluated against the full model above and is split only if it actually exceeds a limit.

### Auto-Split Rule

When a task exceeds two or more signals from the model:

1. Split along vertical-slice boundaries (behavior, entity, layer, or subsystem).
2. Re-evaluate each child against the full model. Repeat recursively.
3. **Max split depth = 3.** If a child still fails, mark it `⚠️ ATOMIC OVERSIZED` and surface for explicit user approval.
4. Document splits with `Split from: {parent-id}` and suffix IDs (`01a`, `01b`).

### Floor Test

The opposite mistake is also possible: splitting a coherent feature into plans that are each too small to justify their own branch, worktree, and review overhead. Before creating a new plan, confirm in writing that it stands alone as an independently shippable, reviewable behaviour change and that its diff materially exceeds the branch/PR/review overhead. If it does not, merge it with a sibling plan instead. This check is advisory — it prompts a written justification, it does not block at scope validation.

## Recorded-Forward Work Queue State

Workflow state is recorded at transition time and trusted on read.

- `aet state transition` is the only writer of `tasks[].state`.
- `aet status`, `aet next`, and the orchestrator read stored `state` directly and make zero git calls on the read path.
- `aet state audit` reconciles stored state against git ground truth on demand; it never runs during normal operation.

### Legal Transitions

```text
sync:        ∅ → planned
sync:        planned → blocked            (pending_blockers > 0)
sync:        planned → ready              (pending_blockers == 0)
transition:  blocked → ready              (last blocker reached terminal)
transition:  ready → in_progress          (branch + worktree recorded)
transition:  in_progress.stage advances   (tdd → implement → qa → review → cso → sync-docs)
transition:  in_progress → awaiting_merge (pipeline exited 0; NOT terminal)
transition:  awaiting_merge → merged      (TERMINAL; merge_commit verified once)
transition:  any → abandoned (reason)     (TERMINAL)
transition:  in_progress → failed         (needs inspection; may re-enter)
```

Terminal states are `merged` and `abandoned`. Only terminal states satisfy blockers; `awaiting_merge` does not.

### Live / Settled Partition

`.agents/work-queue.json` holds only non-terminal tasks. When a task reaches a terminal state, the writer appends its final record and history to `.agents/work-history.jsonl` and removes it from the live file atomically. Settled history is retained for auditability but is never loaded for scheduling.

## Execution Mode

Skills with interactive approval gates must respect the execution-mode contract so they work correctly in both interactive sessions and unattended orchestration.

### Contract

```
Environment variable: AET_EXECUTION_MODE
  - unset or "interactive"  → Default. Hard gates enforced.
  - "unattended"            → Orchestrator/background mode. Gates bypassed with logging.
```

### Gate Bypass Protocol (Unattended Mode)

When `AET_EXECUTION_MODE=unattended` is detected at an approval checkpoint:

1. **List scope.** Still enumerate intended files and magnitude (audit trail).
2. **Log bypass.** Print exactly: `🤖 Unattended mode (AET_EXECUTION_MODE=unattended) — skipping interactive approval. Proceeding with: ~N files, ~M lines changed.`
3. **Continue.** Proceed to the next step; do not ask the user.

### Gates That Must Still Stop in Unattended Mode

Not all gates are bypassed. The following categories **must** halt execution even in unattended mode:

- **ATOMIC OVERSIZED tasks** — No human available to approve scope override. Hard stop with non-zero exit code.
- **Critical security findings** (`aet-cso` Critical/High) — Unattended mode must not auto-approve security risks.
- **Merge verification failures** (`aet-ship`, `post-ship-verify`) — Mechanical check; failure is a hard stop.
- **Autonomous merge** (an agent issuing a PR merge / `gh pr merge`) — The merge action is a human decision; skills are merge-neutral and must not instruct an agent to merge a PR. Fail-closed even in unattended mode (see ADR-029).

### Author Checklist

When adding a new approval gate to a skill:

- [ ] Gate checks `AET_EXECUTION_MODE` before prompting
- [ ] Unattended path logs the bypass with the exact emoji + wording above
- [ ] Gate is categorized as "bypassable" or "hard stop even in unattended mode"
- [ ] Autonomous-merge is fail-closed; skills never instruct a PR merge

## Branch Lifecycle

### Feature Branches

- Branch naming: `<task-id>` or `<type>/<task-id>-<slug>` (e.g., `waf-03-aet-ship-branch-lifecycle`).
- The actual branch name is stored in the work queue `branch` field.
- Feature branches are deleted locally **and remotely** after successful merge verification.
- Do **not** append post-merge commits (plan stage updates, review reports, release bumps) to a branch that has already been merged.

### Release Commits

- `chore(release)` commits and `VERSION` file bumps are **only allowed on `main`**.
- The pre-commit hook rejects release commits on non-main branches.
- `aet-ship` does not bump versions; release versioning is a future skill responsibility.

## Repository Hooks

Hook sources live in `scripts/hooks/`, but the **pre-push** hook is not symlinked by hand. Install it with the dispatcher, which generates a self-contained `.git/hooks/pre-push` shim:

```bash
aet hooks install
```

The **pre-commit** hook is still symlinked from `.git/hooks/`:

```bash
ln -s $(pwd)/scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### pre-push

The generated shim is self-contained — it needs no committed AET file, so it installs cleanly on a repo whose team does not use AET. On each push it:

1. Short-circuits (exits 0 immediately) when **all** pushed refs are branch deletions, so `git push origin --delete` is not blocked.
2. Runs the AET gate-evidence check (`aet hooks check`): for each pushed **task branch** (branch name matches a `docs/plans/<id>.md`), it refuses the push unless every required gate — `qa` and `review` always, `cso` unless `security_review: skipped`, `sync-docs` unless `docs_sync: skipped` — has a recorded `pass` verdict. Non-task branches are a no-op, and no build/coverage gate is imposed by AET itself.
3. Chains to the optional repo-local companion `scripts/hooks/pre-push` when that file is present and executable. In this repo the companion runs `make validate`; a repo that does not use AET omits it and the chain is skipped.

`aet hooks install` is idempotent and never clobbers a pre-existing non-AET hook — it warns and leaves it in place. Re-run it to regenerate a prior AET shim.

### pre-commit

Runs the AE Toolkit quality checks:

- **markdownlint** (`make lint`) on staged markdown files only
- **secrets scan** (via `pre-commit run`, which includes `detect-private-key`)

If the `pre-commit` framework is not installed, the hook falls back to `make lint`.

## Cross-Project Feedback Channel

Projects that use the AE Toolkit may produce retros with findings relevant to the toolkit itself. These are surfaced through a defined `reports/` convention.

### Reports Directory

Each project maintains a `docs/retros/` directory (or equivalent) for retrospectives. Toolkit-relevant retros are marked and mined periodically.

### Toolkit-Relevant Marker

A retro is toolkit-relevant when its frontmatter includes:

```yaml
---
toolkit-relevant: true
---
```

### Required Sections

Every toolkit-relevant retro must contain:

- **Problem** — What went wrong, with concrete example
- **Root cause** — Why it happened (systemic layer, not individual mistake)
- **Fix** — What was changed in the project
- **Prevents** — What rule, check, or gate would have prevented it

### Mining Procedure

Run `aet-evolve --toolkit` periodically (monthly, or after every 5 retros) to scan `reports/*.md` files with `toolkit-relevant: true` and propose toolkit-level changes. See `aet-evolve/SKILL.md` for the full procedure.

The orchestrator writes execution telemetry directly to `~/.aet/telemetry/{project-slug}/{date}/{run-id}/`. Run `aet mine-learnings` periodically to scan the archive for recurring patterns (dependency issues, repeated loops, stage failures, review noise) and propose toolkit-level skill edits.

## Runtime Failure Handling

`aet run` accepts `--on-failure={triage|continue|halt}` (default `triage`). Skills and agents that invoke the batch runner may rely on this default, so new skills should document when they need a non-default mode.

`aet run` accepts `--max-jobs=<n>` (default `4`, maximum `8`) to control batch concurrency. `aet run-one` does not accept this flag.

### Failure taxonomy

All task failures are classified into one of five classes before routing:

- `environment` — missing tool/dependency, network, auth, or permission problem.
- `flaky` — non-deterministic test or transient runtime failure.
- `design` — assertion, lint/style, type, name, or syntax error.
- `timeout` — killed by wall-clock or silence timeout.
- `canceled` — killed by signal or orchestrator shutdown.

### Integration Failure

In `single-pr` mode, a rebase conflict or a post-rebase validation failure is an **Integration Failure** — an engine-level outcome, not a member of the five-class ADR-030 menu above. The task passed; the combination did not. Integration Failures are marked `failed` with an integration signature for human review, are never triaged as task failures, and do not increment the per-task circuit breaker.

- `triage` (default): spawn a triage session that emits `{class, action: requeue|quarantine}`. `requeue` transitions `failed → ready`; `quarantine` transitions to `quarantined`. An errored or unparseable verdict falls back to the nsr-01 default action.
- `continue`: mark `failed` and keep spawning new tasks.
- `halt`: mark `failed` and stop spawning new tasks.

The per-task circuit breaker overrides every mode: three identical signatures on one task always quarantine it.

## Test Parallelization

The orchestrator test suite runs under `pytest-xdist` with `--dist=loadgroup`.
Tests that contend for the same mutable resource are grouped so they serialize
on one worker; tests that contend for different resources run on different
workers concurrently.

When adding an orchestrator test that needs isolation, assign it to the
resource-scoped subgroup that matches the mutable resource it touches:

| Group name      | Shared resource it protects                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `process-group` | Real orchestrator subprocesses and process-group lifecycle. Files in this group may spawn the orchestrator CLI and rely on signal/process-group isolation. |
| `cwd`           | The process-wide current working directory (`os.chdir`, `monkeypatch.chdir`). |
| `telemetry-dir` | Telemetry archive paths and orchestrator state helpers that do not spawn heavy subprocesses or mutate git repos. |
| `git-repo`      | Temporary git repositories created and mutated by the test. |

Rules:

- Do not reintroduce the legacy monolithic `xdist_group("orchestrator")` marker.
- Place a test in the group of its most restrictive shared resource.
- The regression guard in `tests/orchestrator/test_xdist_groups.py` lists the
current file-to-group mapping and must be updated when a new orchestrator file
joins the grouped set.

## Versioning

Skills are versioned implicitly by git commit. No separate version field in frontmatter.
