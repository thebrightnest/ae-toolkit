# Examples for aet-work

This directory contains usage examples for `aet-work`.

The skill supports two task backends:

- **JSON backend** (default): stores the active queue in `.agents/work-queue.json`. No external tooling required.
- **GitHub Issues backend** (opt-in): mirrors tasks as GitHub issues and AET states as labels. Requires the `gh` CLI and a configured repository.

See [`../references/github-backend.md`](../references/github-backend.md) for the GitHub backend label contract, `gh` CLI requirements, and sync behavior.
